## Overview

The `AlieMINI Collection` represents a limited collection of **125** unique cute aliens.

Each NFT in the collection serves as a passport to an exclusive club of collectors, blending art, rarity, and digital companionship.

## Features

**Limited Collection**: Only 125 unique NFTs are available.

This collection is built using the **ERC721A implementation** to save significant amounts of gas when performing mint operations.

User can mint their own AlieMINI NFT by interacting with the function `mintMINI()` and paying the public price.
For each mint transaction, a part of the price that is paid will be sent to the developer of the collection as `FEE`.

The smart contract implements an Airdrop Mechanism that allows the `owner` to **airDrop** AlieMINI tokens to users.
